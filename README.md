Data Hiding in Image-Steganography

Steganography is a technique of hiding a message within image or audio files. It means of storing data in a way that it hides the existence of them. We use this method when we don't want anyone else to see the message other than the sender and the intended receiver. This process helps in enhancing the security of the message.

In this project, I've used the module named **cryptosteganography** in python
